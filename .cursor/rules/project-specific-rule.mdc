This purpose of this project is to build a Sigma plugin that renders a box and whisker plot. There is a separate React file for the iframe component. Use the library Apache Echarts "boxplot"

In the configuration panel the user should be able to select a single data source. There should be column selection options to map columns to the following fields:

1. attribute (this is the grouping key on the x axis. Each group has one box/whisker combo.
2. Min value (bottom of the whisker)
3. Max value (top of the whisker)
4. Median - this is the center line of the box
5. quartile1 - this is the bottom of the box
6. quartile2 - this is the top of the box

There should be a tooltip showing all of the above values.

Practice don't repeat yourself. Use Typescript. Comment your code.
